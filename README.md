# SQL Analysis with the Database "Global Hunger"

This is an analysis using the database "Global Hunger" from Kaggle.
I used the SQL to insert the csv file as my database and create tables by using primary and foreign key to form connections.

My analysis focused on the followings:
1. Create inner join combining 3 tables
2. Creating a stored function that shows the item and the country that have produced a low, good or excellent amount of food in year 1999
3. Subquery with tables item_per_country and production_20thcentury
4. A stored procedure, view and query was created

I have attached the diagram showing all connections between the tables.
